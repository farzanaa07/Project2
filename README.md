Avanade Practical Project Specification

Brief 

The brief provided to us for this project sets the following out as its overall objective: "To create a service-orientated architecture for an application that must be composed of at least 4 services that work together."
This means that I must create a functional web application in ASP.Net using C# and test the code I produce. I must also produce a functional Azure DevOps pipeline that will deploy my code.
